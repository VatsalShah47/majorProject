Kheti is a web application that uses data science to help farmers identify and treat plant diseases. The application is built on Next.js and Flask, and it uses a variety of data science algorithms, including image classification, natural language processing, and machine learning.

Kheti can be used by farmers to identify plant diseases by uploading images of their plants. The application will then use image classification algorithms to identify the disease and provide recommendations for treatment. Kheti can also be used to identify plant diseases by entering a description of the symptoms. The application will then use natural language processing algorithms to identify the disease and provide recommendations for treatment.

In addition to plant disease classification, Kheti also offers a variety of other data science algorithms that can help farmers improve their yields. These algorithms include:

Yield prediction: Kheti can predict the yield of a crop based on a variety of factors, such as the type of crop, the soil quality, and the amount of rainfall.
Pest and disease prediction: Kheti can predict the likelihood of pests and diseases attacking a crop based on a variety of factors, such as the weather conditions and the presence of pests and diseases in the area.
Fertilizer recommendation: Kheti can recommend the optimal amount of fertilizer to use based on the type of crop, the soil quality, and the amount of rainfall.
Kheti is a powerful tool that can help farmers improve their yields and reduce their losses. The application is easy to use and it is available for free. Kheti is a valuable resource for any farmer who wants to improve their crop production.

Here are some additional benefits of using Kheti:

Kheti can help farmers save time and money. By using Kheti, farmers can avoid having to hire experts to identify plant diseases. Kheti can also help farmers avoid having to purchase expensive pesticides and fertilizers.
Kheti can help farmers improve the quality of their crops. By using Kheti, farmers can identify and treat plant diseases early, which can help to prevent the spread of diseases and improve the quality of the crops.
Kheti can help farmers increase their yields. By using Kheti, farmers can identify the optimal amount of fertilizer to use and the best time to plant their crops. This can help to increase the yields of their crops.
If you are a farmer, I encourage you to try Kheti. Kheti is a powerful tool that can help you improve your crop production.
